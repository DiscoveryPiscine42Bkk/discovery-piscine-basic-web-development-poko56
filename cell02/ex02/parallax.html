            <h1>Stray Dogs: A Growing Concern</h1>
            <p>

                Stray dogs are a common sight in many parts of the world. <br> These animals roam the streets, often
                without
                a home or anyone to care for them. <br> Most stray dogs are abandoned pets, while others are born on the
                streets and have never known the comfort of a home. <br> Unfortunately, many of these dogs suffer from
                hunger, disease, and accidents. <br>

                The issue of stray dogs is not just about animal welfare but also affects human health. <br> Stray dogs
                can
                spread diseases like rabies, and they may cause traffic accidents or be involved in attacks on people.
                <br>
                Additionally, the growing number of strays can put pressure on animal shelters and resources. <br>

                Efforts to address this issue include better regulations on pet ownership, public awareness
                campaigns,<br>
                and animal sterilization programs to control the stray population. It is important that communities and
                <br>
                governments work together to protect both animals and people, ensuring a safer environment for everyone.
                <br>

                In conclusion, while stray dogs deserve compassion and care, it is essential to find long-term solutions
                <br>
                to reduce their numbers and provide them with the life they deserve.
